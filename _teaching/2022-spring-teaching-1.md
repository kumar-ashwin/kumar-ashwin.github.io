As an assistant in instruction, I was responsible for providing one-on-one assistance to more than 130 students on coursework and homework assignments covering the mathematical foundations and application of algorithms for search, constraint satisfaction, Markov models, reinforcement learning and propositional and first order logic for the course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence". I graded homework assignments and exams, and conducted office hours to help students with their coursework. I also delivered guest lectures on Reinforcement Learning and conducted problem-solving sessions on Logic and MDPs.
