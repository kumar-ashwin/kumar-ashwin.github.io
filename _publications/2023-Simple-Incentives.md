title: "Using Simple Incentives to Improve Two-Sided Fairness in Ridesharing Systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-Simple-Incentives
excerpt: 'In this paper, I explore how we can improve the fairness of ridesharing systems by using a simple, incentive-based approach to improve worse-off groups over time. Since this is a post-processing method for fairness, it can be applied to a multitude of matching algorithms, and is shown experimentally to have better fairness-efficiency trade-offs than previous state-of-the-art approaches.'

In this paper, I explore how we can improve the fairness of ridesharing systems by using a simple, incentive-based approach to improve worse-off groups over time. Since this is a post-processing method for fairness, it can be applied to a multitude of matching algorithms, and is shown experimentally to have better fairness-efficiency trade-offs than previous state-of-the-art approaches.
