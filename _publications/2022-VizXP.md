This paper looks at the advantages of conveying explanations to users in model reconciliation problems using visualizations. We present a visualization framework, VizXP, that allows users to explore the explanations generated by the MRP algorithm. We also present a user study using VizXP that demonstrates people understand explanations better when they are delivered using a combination of visualization and text, as opposed to text alone.
