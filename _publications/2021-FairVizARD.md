We designed an interactive visualization that let users compare different ridesharing-matching algorithms on the basis of different fairness criteria. Through a combination of maps and charts, users could explore the fairness of the matching algorithms, and the trade-offs between different fairness and efficiency across different stakeholders, such as drivers and riders, for NYC taxi data.
